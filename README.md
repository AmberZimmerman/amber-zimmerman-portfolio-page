A portfolio page about Amber Zimmerman. This page outlines Amber's career interests as well as highlights her developer projects. 

When a user clicks the words in the navigation bar, the user is brought to that section in the viewport. These sections include an about me section, a gallery of works, and a contact footer. The project gallery photos are organized through the use of hierarchy, with the most impressive project photo taking up a larger portion (multiple columns) of the overall grid.

A user can click on these project photos and eventually be taken to these project pages. Currently bare html pages are the placeholders for future application projects.
